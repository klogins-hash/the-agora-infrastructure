# The Agora Infrastructure Deployment - Final Status

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Cluster:** the-agora (ch-gva-2)  
**Status:** 90% Complete - Cluster Running, Storage Issue Blocking Databases

---

## What's Working ✅

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster (100% Operational)
- **Cluster ID:** cb6300d0-9473-4707-bdc1-b0a5f76fc66a
- **Endpoint:** cb6300d0-9473-4707-bdc1-b0a5f76fc66a.sks-ch-gva-2.exo.io
- **Kubernetes Version:** 1.29
- **Control Plane:** FREE (managed by Exoscale)
- **Status:** Fully operational

### 2. Node Pools (All Running)

| Pool | Purpose | Instance Type | Nodes | CPU | RAM | Disk | Status |
|------|---------|---------------|-------|-----|-----|------|--------|
| Database | PostgreSQL, Valkey, RabbitMQ | standard.huge | 3 | 24 | 48GB | 150GB | ✅ Running |
| Storage | MinIO | standard.large | 4 | 16 | 32GB | 1.6TB | ✅ Running |
| Application | Future app workloads | standard.large | 3 | 12 | 24GB | 300GB | ✅ Running |
| **Total** | | | **10** | **52** | **104GB** | **2.05TB** | ✅ Running |

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/the-agora-infrastructure/`
- **Terraform State:** Local (can be migrated to S3 or Kubernetes later)
- **All Configuration:** Version controlled and reproducible

### 4. CSI Driver (Partially Working)
- **CSI Controllers:** ✅ Running (2/2 pods healthy)
- **CSI Node Pods:** ⚠️ Running but not registering topology
- **Storage Classes Created:**
  - `exoscale-sbs` (Immediate binding)
  - `exoscale-sbs-wait` (WaitForFirstConsumer binding)

---

## What's NOT Working ❌

### Exoscale Block Storage CSI Driver - Node Registration Issue

**Problem:** CSI node driver pods can't register topology information with Kubernetes

**Symptoms:**
- CSI node plugin containers start but crash before creating gRPC socket
- Logs show: "fallback on server metadata" then silence
- CSI node driver registrar can't connect to plugin socket
- Volume provisioning fails with: "no topology key found on CSINode"

**Root Cause:** The CSI node plugin is trying to:
1. Read instance metadata from CD-ROM device (`/dev/disk/by-label/cidata`) - doesn't exist on SKS nodes
2. Fallback to Exoscale metadata service - appears to fail silently
3. This prevents the plugin from determining the node's zone
4. Without zone info, it can't register topology with Kubernetes
5. Without topology, the CSI controller can't provision volumes

**What We Tried:**
1. ✅ Fixed API credentials in secret
2. ✅ Restarted all CSI pods
3. ✅ Added `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` labels to all nodes manually
4. ✅ Created storage class with explicit zone parameter
5. ✅ Tried both Immediate and WaitForFirstConsumer binding modes
6. ❌ CSI node pods still can't register topology

## Database Deployment Status

All 4 databases are deployed via Helm but **stuck in Pending** state waiting for storage:

| Database | Chart | Version | Status | Reason |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | bitnami/postgresql | 18.0 | ⏳ Pending | PVC can't provision |
| Valkey | bitnami/valkey | 8.1 | ⏳ Pending | PVC can't provision |
| RabbitMQ | bitnami/rabbitmq | 4.1 | ⏳ Pending | PVC can't provision |
| MinIO | bitnami/minio | latest | ⏳ Pending | PVC can't provision |

**PVCs Created:** 7 total (all Pending)
**Storage Class:** exoscale-sbs-wait
**Total Storage Requested:** ~1.44 TiB

## Solutions to Consider

### Option 1: Debug CSI Node Driver (Recommended for Production)
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Difficulty:** Medium-High  

**Steps:**
1. Check if Exoscale metadata service is accessible from pods
2. Verify API key has all required IAM permissions
3. Manually deploy CSI driver with debug logging
4. Check if there's a known issue with SKS + CSI driver version mismatch
5. Contact Exoscale support if needed

**Pros:**
- Official solution
- Fully supported by Exoscale
- Best performance
- Production-ready

**Cons:**
- Requires more debugging time
- May need Exoscale support involvement

---

### Option 2: Use Exoscale Managed DBaaS (Fastest)
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

**What to do:**
1. Use Exoscale's managed PostgreSQL and Redis (Valkey-compatible)
2. Self-host RabbitMQ and MinIO on local node storage (ephemeral)
3. For production, add backup/restore scripts

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- 99.99% SLA on databases
- Automatic backups
- No storage debugging needed

**Cons:**
- You said you don't want managed DBaaS (too restrictive)
- Monthly cost ~€200 more
- Less control over database configuration

---

### Option 3: Use NFS/Longhorn/Other Storage (Workaround)
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

**Options:**
- **Longhorn:** We tried this, had similar CSI issues
- **NFS:** Set up external NFS server, mount to pods
- **Rook/Ceph:** Distributed storage, complex setup
- **Local Path Provisioner:** Uses local node storage (no replication)

**Pros:**
- Bypasses Exoscale Block Storage issues
- Full control
- Works with existing setup

**Cons:**
- Not using Exoscale's native storage
- May have performance/reliability trade-offs
- More complex to maintain

---

### Option 4: Deploy Without Persistence (Testing Only)
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

**What to do:**
1. Modify Helm values to disable persistence
2. Databases run in-memory
3. Data lost on pod restart

**Pros:**
- Databases start immediately
- Can test application logic
- Good for development

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **NOT FOR PRODUCTION**
- All data lost on restart
- Not suitable for real workloads

## Monthly Cost Breakdown

### Current Infrastructure
| Resource | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|

| Block Storage (if working) | 1.44 TiB | ~€0.10/GB | €147 |
| **Total with Storage** | | | **~€950/mo** |

### If Using Managed DBaaS Instead

|----------|------|
| Current compute | €800 |
| Managed PostgreSQL | ~€150 |
| Managed Redis | ~€50 |
| **Total** | **~€1000/mo** |

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Choose One):**
1. **Continue debugging CSI** - Best for production, requires more time
2. **Switch to managed DBaaS** - Fastest path to working system
3. **Try alternative storage** - Middle ground solution

**After Storage is Resolved:**
1. Deploy application workloads
2. Set up ingress/load balancer
3. Configure DNS
4. Set up monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
5. Configure backups
6. Migrate Terraform state to remote backend

## Summary

**What You Have:**
- ✅ Production-ready Kubernetes cluster (10 nodes, 52 CPUs, 104GB RAM)
- ✅ All infrastructure defined as code (Terraform)
- ✅ Database configurations ready (Helm values)
- ✅ CSI driver installed and partially working

**What's Blocking:**
- ❌ CSI node driver topology registration issue
- ❌ Can't provision Block Storage volumes
- ❌ Databases stuck in Pending state

**Bottom Line:** Your cluster is 90% ready. The only blocker is the Exoscale Block Storage CSI driver not registering node topology. This is likely a configuration or permissions issue that can be resolved with more debugging, or you can choose one of the workaround options above to get databases running immediately.
